# farcryLoginModal
While in the webtop editing content if your session times out you won't know untill you try to save your work. At that point you will loose any changes from the last successful save.

This plugin will poll farcry every 6 seconds to see if you're still logged in. If not it will produce a modal over all other modals with the login view. 
Once sucessfully logged in again it will hide the modal and not refresh the page allowing you to continue.
